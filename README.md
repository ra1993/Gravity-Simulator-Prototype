# Gravity-Simulator-Prototype
Final Project for Mobile Applications Class: Had to create an innovative app with a presentation and a prototype. Used CoronaSDK and Lua

Details:
-The idea of the app was to create a simulator that visualized the effects of gravity from the different planets in our solar system. 
-This is just a proto-type of something that has much more potential. 
-May continue to work on this sometime in the future.
